This scripts spawns tools (cans) ingame that is available to equip.

what you can do with this is, if yk how to make models and stuff.
You can make ur own UI and replicate the tools this script gives u into something like
"angel wings" or a "titan". this works as of 2025 december.


This was an old script used back in 2020 roblox, esp in ragdoll engine.
You mightve seen the hand script and stuff, but as of now there isnt much that even work or are FE.
If you know what ur doing or have a replication UI script, you could use this to make an FE can script that replicates the toggle.
